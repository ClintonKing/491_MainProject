1. Write JS for submit form based on leaderboard example. Add success prompt to submit button.

2. Have index.html pull from firebase and write trees to html in style of masonry boxes.

3. implement infinite scroll box to contain masonry.

4. Replace flipcards with Foundation Modal boxes.

5. Add user profiles through firebase. Append user login requirement to submission form.
